SnapChat like app using "React Native"
==============

React Native just released so I give it a try and create this project. 
--------------

**App Flow:**
- You capture an image
- You can add text as water mark
- Share with your friend using FB Messenger.

**How To Run**
- Currently the app loaded from static pre-bundled file. You can just run it.
- To modify the code you will need to install "React Native" (http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content). You can modify "AppDelegate.m" to let it run on your local server.
